I hold an MSc (integrated master) and a BSc in Agricultural Biotechnology from the Agricultural University of Athens, an MBA in Economic–Engineering Systems from the joint postgraduate program of the National Technical University of Athens and the University of Piraeus, and a PhD from the Informatics Laboratory of the Agricultural University of Athens. I have worked at the Ministry of Rural Development and Food, served as a Seconded National Expert and external collaborator at the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in Italy, and worked as a Researcher at the Agricultural University of Athens. I have published over 60 papers in scientific journals, edited volumes, and refereed conferences, as well as more than 60 reports for the European Commission. My research interests include the design, development, and implementation of information systems for Internet service provision; the use of Internet technologies for services (e-commerce, e-government, e-learning); social network analysis; mobile app development; business models and innovation services in the digital economy; information systems modeling; and business process analysis. I have also served on working groups for several funded projects in these areas.</p>
